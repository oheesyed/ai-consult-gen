# Consultant Report Generator

This project is a Next.js application for generating consultant reports based on website content and user instructions.

## Inputs

- **URL:** The URL of the website to analyze.
- **Instructions:** Specific guidance for the report's focus and content.
- **Report Editor:** A rich text editor powered by Tiptap, where users can create or edit the report's content directly.

## Outputs

- **Generated Report:** An HTML report generated by OpenAI's GPT model based on the website content and user instructions.
- **Random Report Samples:** A set of pre-written sample reports that users can insert into the editor for inspiration or modification.

## Functionality

The core workflow involves submitting a URL and instructions to the application. The application then crawls the provided URL using Firecrawl to extract website content. This content, along with the instructions, is sent to OpenAI's GPT model via their API to generate a consultant report in HTML format. The report is then displayed in the report editor within the application.

The user can further edit and refine the generated report using Tiptap editor, which provides various formatting options. Additionally, users can generate random reports based on a predefined set of sample reports, which serve as templates or inspiration.
